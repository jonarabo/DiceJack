# DiceJack

My program is a spin of the casino game known as Blackjack. Instead of the normal game that is played with a deck of playing cards, the program that I have created is played with an 8 sided dice. Additionally, it incorporates a wager and balance system in which the player is given a starting balance of $1000 and they must gamble their way to over $2000 in order to be able to redeem a prize. Just like normal Blackjack, the player is against the dealer, and in my program, the target number is 16. The dealer will continue to roll dice until they reach 13, 14, 15, or 16, in which they are forced to stand. On the other hand, the player has complete control of when they would like to hit or stand. However, for both the dealer and the player, if the sum of their dice roll exceeds 16, they bust and lose that hand. I first created the base game in C and then focused on making a more complex version in MIPS assembly language.
